Usage:
Put the /pp3data folder into this folder and run "task1.py" "task2.py" or "bonus.py" (with python 3.5 or above).

Code structure:
/core/metrics.py: functions that calculates MSE/classification error rate, and data points on learning curves.
/core/bingenerative.py: implements the binary generative model, including training and predicting.
/core/bayeslogistic.py: implements Bayes Logistic Regression with 3 updating methods(Newton, GD and SGD); includes training and predicting.
/utils/dataset.py: contains a function that randomly splits the dataset for Cross Validation and a function that draw random subset of specified size from the data set.
/task1.py: code for Task 1.
/task2.py: code for Task 2, meanwhile performing the same task for Stochastic GD.
/bonus.py: test different learning rates for Stochastic GD.
/core/linreg.py: not used; copied from the last programming project.
